## Ports

Port is a numerical identifier that helps differentiate and direct data traffic to the appropriate service on a machine. It is similar to how wharfs at a harbor are designated locations for ships to dock.

If your Node.js server is running on port 3000, it means the server is stationed at the "wharf" or port 3000. Clients connecting to this server need to specify the port (e.g., http://localhost:3000) to establish communication with the Node.js service.

## Why ports?

Ports enable multiple services to run independently on the same machine without interference. Each service is associated with a unique port, ensuring that incoming data or requests are directed to the correct service.

Here is the common [port numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)
